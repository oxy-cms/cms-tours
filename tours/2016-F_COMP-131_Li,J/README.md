# First "Snack Hack" Code Tour in the CMS

Given the challenge of giving a one hour tour of the Critical Making Studio (CMS) for an introductory computer science course taught by Justin Li, we opted to focus on a small, semi-structured hack session with five groups working at coding or work stations. After a brief introduction to the Space, facilities, peer learning resources, and lending opportunities, we introduced the whole group (over 20) to each of the stations.
